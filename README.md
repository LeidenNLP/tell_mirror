# Turkish Electronic Living Lexicon

## For use in the course Python for Linguists 2

This repository simply mirrors two files from UC Berkeley's TELL (Turkish Electronic Living Lexicon) v2, 2009, the originals available from: https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/TELL

The two files are in 'tab separated' format.

- **ELICIT.db.txt**: Contains lexemes with phonological transcriptions of various morphological variants, and information about which of these words some specific speaker actually knows/uses.
- **ETYMA.db.txt**: Contains etymological information of _some_ of the aforementioned lexemes. Note that, in this file, any characters with diacritics have been (purposefully? accidentally?) replaced by the basic character followed by the at sign (@).
